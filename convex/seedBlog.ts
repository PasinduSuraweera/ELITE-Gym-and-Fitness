          <h2>Why Core Strength Matters</h2>
          <p>Your core is the foundation of all movement. A strong core improves posture, reduces back pain, and enhances athletic performance. These 10 exercises will help you build a solid foundation.</p>
          
          <h2>The Essential Exercises</h2>
          <h3>1. Plank</h3>
          <p>The classic plank is the cornerstone of core training. Start with 30 seconds and work your way up to 2 minutes.</p>
          
          <h3>2. Dead Bug</h3>
          <p>This exercise teaches core stability while moving your limbs independently.</p>
          
          <h3>3. Bird Dog</h3>
          <p>Perfect for improving coordination and core stability.</p>
          
          <h3>4. Russian Twists</h3>
          <p>Target your obliques with this rotational movement.</p>
          
          <h3>5. Mountain Climbers</h3>
          <p>Combine cardio with core strengthening in this dynamic exercise.</p>
          
          <h2>How to Progress</h2>
          <p>Start with 2-3 sets of each exercise, 2-3 times per week. Focus on form over speed or repetitions.</p>

          <h2>Fuel Your Performance</h2>
          <p>What you eat before and after your workout can significantly impact your performance, recovery, and results. Let's break down the science of workout nutrition.</p>
          
          <h2>Pre-Workout Nutrition</h2>
          <h3>Timing</h3>
          <p>Eat your pre-workout meal 1-3 hours before training, depending on the size of the meal.</p>
          
          <h3>What to Eat</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Your body's preferred fuel source</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate Protein:</strong> Supports muscle protein synthesis</li>
            <li><strong>Low Fat:</strong> Avoid foods that slow digestion</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Pre-Workout Meal Ideas</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Banana with almond butter</li>
            <li>Greek yogurt with berries</li>
            <li>Oatmeal with protein powder</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Post-Workout Nutrition</h2>
          <h3>The Anabolic Window</h3>
          <p>While not as critical as once believed, eating within 2 hours post-workout optimizes recovery.</p>
          
          <h3>Recovery Essentials</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Protein:</strong> 20-40g to stimulate muscle protein synthesis</li>
            <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Replenish glycogen stores</li>
            <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Replace fluids lost through sweat</li>

        content: `
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Even with the best intentions, many gym-goers unknowingly make mistakes that hinder their progress. Our trainers see these errors daily. Here are the top 5 mistakes and how to fix them.</p>
          
          <h2>Mistake #1: Skipping Warm-Up</h2>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Jumping straight into intense exercise without preparing your body.</p>
          <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Spend 5-10 minutes with dynamic movements like leg swings, arm circles, and light cardio.</p>
          
          <h2>Mistake #2: Poor Form</h2>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Prioritizing weight over proper technique.</p>
          <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Master bodyweight movements first, then gradually add resistance while maintaining perfect form.</p>
          
          <h2>Mistake #3: Not Progressive Overload</h2>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Using the same weights and reps week after week.</p>
          <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets every 1-2 weeks to continue challenging your muscles.</p>
          
          <h2>Mistake #4: Ignoring Recovery</h2>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Training the same muscles every day without adequate rest.</p>
          <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Allow 48 hours between training the same muscle groups. Focus on sleep and stress management.</p>
          
          <h2>Mistake #5: Inconsistent Training</h2>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Working out sporadically without a structured plan.</p>
          <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Create a realistic schedule you can stick to. Consistency beats intensity every time.</p>
          
          <h2>Take Action</h2>
          <p>Identify which mistakes you might be making and focus on fixing one at a time. Consider working with a personal trainer to ensure you're on the right track.</p>
